Hello User!

To play, simply run the program, and some instructions will appear. 

Press any key to begin playing!

Up-Arrow: Jump
Down-Arrow: Crouch


If you hit an obstacle (Cactus or Comet), the game will end, and you will get a prompt.

R: Restart
Q: Quit


(In our demo file, I pressed Q to quit, and it closed the application. So, my recording ended automatically, but it works!
